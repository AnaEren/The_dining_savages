# The_dining_savages
Solution to "The dining savages" problem:
```
A tribe of savages eats communal dinners from a large pot that can hold M servings of stewed missionary. 
When a savage wants to eat, he helps himself from the pot, unless it is empty. 
If the pot is empty, the savage wakes up the cook and then waits until the cook has refilled the pot.
```
